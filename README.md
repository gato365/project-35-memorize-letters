# Memorize Letters

Welcome to Project 35 - Memorize Letters! This project is a web-based memory game that tests your ability to memorize and recall a secret phrase.

## Overview

The game works as follows:

1. **Number Input Field**: The user is prompted to enter a number between 0 and 50.

2. **Reveal Secret Button**: Upon clicking the "Reveal Secret" button, one of two secret phrases is displayed based on the number entered by the user.

3. **Memorization Timer**: A 25-second countdown timer starts as soon as the secret phrase is revealed. During this time, the user is expected to memorize the secret phrase.

4. **Automatic Concealment of the Secret**: The secret phrase automatically disappears from the display after the 25-second countdown.

5. **Secret Entry Textbox and Timer**: A textbox appears for the user to type in the memorized secret, and a 15-second countdown timer starts.

6. **Input Evaluation**: The textbox is disabled after 15 seconds, and the user's input is compared with the original secret phrase to calculate the number of characters correctly recalled.

7. **Result Display and Data Export Prompt**: The number of correctly remembered characters is displayed to the user. The user is then advised to copy their result and paste it into a provided Google survey link for data collection.
